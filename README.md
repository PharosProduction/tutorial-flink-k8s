## Flink session cluster on Kubernetes
A basic Flink session cluster deployment in Kubernetes has three components:

a Deployment/Job which runs the JobManager
a Deployment for a pool of TaskManagers
a Service exposing the JobManagerâ€™s REST and UI ports

## If using MiniKube please make sure to execute:

minikube ssh 'sudo ip link set docker0 promisc on'

before deploying a Flink cluster. Otherwise Flink components are not able to self reference themselves through a Kubernetes service.

## Deploy Flink session cluster on Kubernetes
